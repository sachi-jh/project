Our project is comprised of three main components, so component & unit testing is as simple as taking the program through
its normal paces. 
Weather Feature:
    Simply create an event, and weather will be provided for the date range chosen
Input Availability Feature:
    To test this feature, attempt to repeatedly join the same event using different usernames to show how the
    availability display works
Event Creation Feature:
    Navigate to the event creation page and create it with the desired range. The event will be created in the backend's jsonStorage folder.
Show Availability Feature:
    After inputting availability, go to the following page to see the shared availabilites of all users who have signed up for that event.
